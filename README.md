#Amethyst

A node.js app for monitoring internet usage. Good for shared wi-fi. So that all the people that are connected can let the other users know if he is downloading or just browsing. If one user changes his status to downloading and other users are currently doing something important which needs a good internet speed then he can just use the group chat in order to let that other user know to stop his download for a while until he finishes what he's doing. 


##Features

- Toggle between browsing and downloading 
- Group Chat
